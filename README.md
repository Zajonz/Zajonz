## Hey there! 👋

I'm a 17-year-old student starting my journey in robotics.

I design, build and program robots — especially for robot-sumo competitions.

Member of Polish Robotic Team, passionate about engineering, calisthenics, animals, and occasionally streaming.

Currently developing a 3Kg sumo robot

I use tools like KiCad, Autodesk Fusion, VS Code, and the Arduino IDE for development and design.

If you'd like to get in touch, here's my email: lukaszonz081@gmail.com.
